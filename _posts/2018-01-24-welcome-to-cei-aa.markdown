This is a website dedicated to news on the progress of the CEI - Working Group on Atrial Arrhythmias. Our goals are 1) to develop new standards for ECG(i) preprocessing, analysis and visualisation of atrial signals; 2) to create a pipeline for standardised evaluation and validation of algorithm performance; and 3) to create a platform where researchers can exchange ideas and data.
